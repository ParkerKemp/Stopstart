# Stopstart
Stopstart is a simple Minecraft plugin, designed as part of the Spinalcraft Suite, which allows the server to be restarted from within. It is basically a single command which invokes a local shell script (code not currently available) to shut down the server, monitor the process until it's completely gone, and then start the server again without worry of conficting resource usage.
